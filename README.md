# toxspammer
toxspammer spams many friend requests to the supplied target key, in effect being a denial of service attempt.
It is a tool used for penetration testing [Tox](https://tox.chat) clients, which should ideally be able to
deal with such attacks. toxspammer should not be used without the explicit consent of the target.

### Compiling
Compile and install [toxcore](https://github.com/toktok/c-toxcore).
Clone this repo then run the command `make`.
